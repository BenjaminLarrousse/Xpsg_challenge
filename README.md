# Code for the Sport Analytics Challenge of PSG and Ecole Polytechnique

Link to the challenge: https://www.agorize.com/fr/challenges/xpsg?lang=en

In this project you can find code I wrote for the challenge. I used deep learning algorithms (in particular LSTM) to tackle the three prediction problems.

Brief description:
* install_psgx.py can be run to install the requirements with pipenv.
* main_psgx.py contains the Result() function to make predictions, and functions to create the deep learning algorithms (in Keras).
* utils.py contains functions to preprocess the data.
* model_playerid.h5, model_teamid.h5 and model_xy.h5 are Keras models.
